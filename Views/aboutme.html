			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>Hi there, I'm Buyan, currently a master student at the University of Melbourne. </p>
			<p>My major is <b>MIT(HCI)</b>, which is Master of Information Technology(Human-Computer Interaction), love it so much and try my best to make it my life-long passion.</p>
			<p>Its my third semester at uni already, so I'll spend my summer at melb and try to find myself an internship, which will not be a easy thing.</p>
			<p>But it will be my first job, I've got a interview offer on 19 Nov, I'll force myself to get a pass!!!</p>
			<p>I can do web development, basically on Nodejs and HTML/CSS, and thanks to HCI, I can do design and prototyping, which is somehow related to user experience(UX) as well.</p>
			<p>What I've done recently is a VR reading project, which somehow intrigued me in game developing, using Unity, specifically. But I'm not really a game-fan, so I'll see how this one goes :).</p>
			<p>About my <b>future path</b>, I'm still hesitating between UX designer and full-stack developer, but I think I can find a way connect those two.</p>
