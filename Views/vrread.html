					<p><b>Motivation</b></p>
					<p><li>Tired of holding a thick book: What if books can float themselves? An actual book can not, but a virtual book definitely can!</li></p>
					<p><li>Virtual reading is very common in big screens, but in reality, VR has been widely used in education and entertaiment, but not in reading.</li></p>
					<p><li><a href="https://www.oculus.com/story-studio/films/henry/">'Henry'</a> by Oculus: an interactive book character.</li></p>
					<p><li>Awesome work done by Mike Alger, who made an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=id86HeV-Vb8&t=96s&index=15&list=PLh34SjHwef6nKoysLCzjh9cge44E86I6Q">VR interface</a> that almost allow VR to be an substitute for PCs. </li></p>

					<p><b>Related work</b></p>
					<p>Reading has been always a very natural way of people obsorbing knowledge. We found that there have been a few studies focus on the virtual environment reading, they explored ways of presenting reading content, and media such as sounds effects that can be used for virtual reading.</p>
					<p>During reading, a single media effect brings less disturbing experience than multi-media effects. The multi-media effects should be carefully designed and tested for its reading experience.</p>
					<p>Among paging, scrolling and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_serial_visual_presentation">RSVP</a>, while RSVP can be very effective acting as a prompt for notification, paging and scrolling remain as the most common ways of reading, which bring better reading experience and comprehension of content.</p>
					<p>With related studies that provide relevant guidelines, this project, therefore, will have those guidelines for the initial design and implementation.</p>
